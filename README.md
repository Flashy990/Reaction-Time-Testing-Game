# Reaction Testing Game
This is my first Unity project. Its a simple game to test your reaction time. Press "Enter" to start and hit space when the screen turns green to see how fast you react.

## TODO
- Add a UI to show the player reaction time on top left.
- Add play again screen.
- Add a database of player tries and graph the reaction times to see imporvements or changes over time.
